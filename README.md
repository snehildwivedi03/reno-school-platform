### üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup

```sql
CREATE DATABASE school_directory;

USE school_directory;

CREATE TABLE schools (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    contact VARCHAR(20),
    image VARCHAR(255),
    email_id VARCHAR(255)
);
```

## Backend & Frontend Setup and API Endpoints

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd Reno-Platforms/backend`
3. Install NPM packages: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with your database credentials:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_DATABASE=school_directory
DB_PORT=3306

5. Start the backend server: `node server.js`  
   Your backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
6. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory: `cd Reno-Platforms/frontend`
7. Install NPM packages: `npm install`
8. Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with the following content:

9. Start the frontend development server: `npm run dev`  
   Your React application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
